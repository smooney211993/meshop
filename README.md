// Improvements to be made?//
Due to the project being a personal project, my git commits are lacking in professionalism and structure with some commits lacking details of any new features added, bugs encountered or what was changed in solutions. I recognise that this is a extremely bad practise and makes it difficult for team members to see what  exactly went wrong when debugging.

Integrate a confirmation email feature when order has been paid - maybe use sendgrid api?
